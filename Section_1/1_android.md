October  2003, Palo Alto, California<br><br>
*Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears and Chris White* founded Android Inc. And if you are wondering why it was named 'Android', it's because of Andy Rubin's love for robots, that his co-workers at Apple named him *Android* and that nickname eventually became the official name of the **Android Operating System**. <br><br>
But this 'Android' was far from the Android that we know today, that you are probably reading this article on. The early intentions of the **Android Inc.** was to create an Operating System for Digital Cameras and about 5 months later they diverted their efforts and pitched Android as a handset Operating System that would rival Symbian and the Windows Mobile Platform(R.I.P).<br>
